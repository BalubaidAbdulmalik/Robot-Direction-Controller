# Robot-Direction-Controller

I used HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to make the web page responsive.

here you have five buttons to click once you click on a button it will be save in the database.
after that i compined the two functions in one web page and i make it responsive so it can be used in mobile phones.

* there are two files robot-arm-controller for the program and controlpanel.sql for the database.
